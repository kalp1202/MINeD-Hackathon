#Project Title - Applied ML for manufacturing Industry's problem

#Problem Statement - We have to develop a Image processing Algorithm for Identification of Week number on Cement Bag on a running belt, color of Character is Black , Cement Bag color may be black , White, Green, Yellow. In this algorithm if we found any bag without week no , we have put an entry in SQL database (Which will be utilized for stopping the Belt).

Project that detects whether information like batch number , MRP is printed on a cement bag or not

#installation in anaconda
conda install OpenCV 

We needed to pre-process the images or video footage so that we could classify if the number on the cement bag was present or not, and then denote 0 if the number was not imprinted and 1 if it was.
